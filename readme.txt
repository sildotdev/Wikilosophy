We developed a site that utilizes AWS's Lambda Functions. It connects to Wikipedia's servers to then observe the phenomenon that clicking the first non-parenthesized link in the article eventually leads to "Philosophy" most of the time. The user will input an article, and, after some time, the website will show the user the path it takes to get to "Philosophy" if it is able.
